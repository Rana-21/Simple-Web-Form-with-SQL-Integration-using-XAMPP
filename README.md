# Simple-Web-Form-with-SQL-Integration-using-XAMPP
This project demonstrates how to create a simple web form that allows users to submit their names, which are then stored in a MySQL database. The database and table were created using **phpMyAdmin** inside **XAMPP**.

# Technologies Used
- XAMPP (Apache + MySQL)
- PHP
- HTML/CSS
- MySQL (via phpMyAdmin)
  
#  How It Works
1. The user opens the website and enters their name and age into a form.
2. When the form is submitted, PHP handles the request and connects to the MySQL database.
3. The name is inserted into a table in the database.
4. The table was created manually using phpMyAdmin in XAMPP.
